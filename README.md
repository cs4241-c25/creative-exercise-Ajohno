I used Three.js for this assignment.

- Virtual Agent

For the virtual agent, the a path is drawn from the points into the 3d environment. A green cube is then created and is moves along the predetermined path and faces the direction it is moving. This animation is looped continuously.

- Game

For the simple game a cube is created in the virtual environment. There are event listeners for when the arrow keys are pressed and released. The cube moves a certain amount in a specific direction based on which arrow key is pressed and how long it is held down.

- Audio Visualizer

For the audio visualizer, the script checks if any audio is already playing and if there is stops it and plays the audio from the start. The bars that are created are scaled based on an array of data that holds the byte frequency from the mp3 file.
